/**
 * 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
 *
 * Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
