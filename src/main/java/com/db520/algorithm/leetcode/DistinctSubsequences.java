/**
 * 115. Distinct Subsequences
 *
 * Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
